.PP
There is no need to tell \fBWireshark\fR what type of
file you are reading; it will determine the file type by itself.
\&\fBWireshark\fR is also capable of reading any of these file formats if they
are compressed using gzip.  \fBWireshark\fR recognizes this directly from
the file; the '.gz' extension is not required for this purpose.
.PP
Like other protocol analyzers, \fBWireshark\fR's main window shows 3 views
of a packet.  It shows a summary line, briefly describing what the
packet is.  A packet details display is shown, allowing you to drill
down to exact protocol or field that you interested in.  Finally, a hex
dump shows you exactly what the packet looks like when it goes over the
wire.
.PP
In addition, \fBWireshark\fR has some features that make it unique.  It can
assemble all the packets in a TCP conversation and show you the ASCII
(or EBCDIC, or hex) data in that conversation.  Display filters in
\&\fBWireshark\fR are very powerful; more fields are filterable in \fBWireshark\fR
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax you can use to create
your filters is richer.  As \fBWireshark\fR progresses, expect more and more
protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
.PP
Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library.  The capture filter
syntax follows the rules of the pcap library.  This syntax is different
from the display filter syntax.
.PP
Compressed file support uses (and therefore requires) the zlib library.
If the zlib library is not present, \fBWireshark\fR will compile, but will
be unable to read compressed files.
.PP
The pathname of a capture file to be read can be specified with the
\&\fB\-r\fR option or can be specified as a command-line argument.
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Most users will want to start \fBWireshark\fR without options and configure
it from the menus instead.  Those users may just skip this section.
.IP "\-a  <capture autostop condition>" 4
.IX Item "-a <capture autostop condition>"
Specify a criterion that specifies when \fBWireshark\fR is to stop writing
to a capture file.  The criterion is of the form \fItest\fR\fB:\fR\fIvalue\fR,
where \fItest\fR is one of:
.Sp
\&\fBduration\fR:\fIvalue\fR Stop writing to a capture file after \fIvalue\fR seconds have
elapsed. Floating point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.
.Sp
\&\fBfiles\fR:\fIvalue\fR Stop writing to capture files after \fIvalue\fR number of files
were written.
.Sp
\&\fBfilesize\fR:\fIvalue\fR Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of
\&\fIvalue\fR kB.  If this option is used together with the \-b option, Wireshark
will stop writing to the current capture file and switch to the next one if
filesize is reached.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of
2 GiB.
.Sp
\&\fBpackets\fR:\fIvalue\fR switch to the next file after it contains \fIvalue\fR
packets. Same as \fB\-c\fR<capture packet count>.
.IP "\-b  <capture ring buffer option>" 4
.IX Item "-b <capture ring buffer option>"
Cause \fBWireshark\fR to run in "multiple files" mode.  In "multiple files" mode,
\&\fBWireshark\fR will write to several capture files.  When the first capture file
fills up, \fBWireshark\fR will switch writing to the next file and so on.
.Sp
The created filenames are based on the filename given with the \fB\-w\fR flag,
the number of the file and on the creation date and time,
e.g. outfile_00001_20190714120117.pcap, outfile_00002_20190714120523.pcap, ...
.Sp
With the \fIfiles\fR option it's also possible to form a "ring buffer".
This will fill up new files until the number of files specified,
at which point \fBWireshark\fR will discard the data in the first file and start
writing to that file and so on.  If the \fIfiles\fR option is not set,
new files filled up until one of the capture stop conditions match (or
until the disk is full).
.Sp
The criterion is of the form \fIkey\fR\fB:\fR\fIvalue\fR,
where \fIkey\fR is one of:
.Sp
\&\fBduration\fR:\fIvalue\fR switch to the next file after \fIvalue\fR seconds have
elapsed, even if the current file is not completely filled up. Floating
point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.
.Sp
\&\fBfiles\fR:\fIvalue\fR begin again with the first file after \fIvalue\fR number of
files were written (form a ring buffer).  This value must be less than 100000.
Caution should be used when using large numbers of files: some filesystems do
not handle many files in a single directory well.  The \fBfiles\fR criterion
requires either \fBduration\fR, \fBinterval\fR or \fBfilesize\fR to be specified to
control when to go to the next file.  It should be noted that each \fB\-b\fR
parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify two criterion, each must be
preceded by the \fB\-b\fR option.
.Sp
\&\fBfilesize\fR:\fIvalue\fR switch to the next file after it reaches a size of
\&\fIvalue\fR kB.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 GiB.
.Sp
\&\fBinterval\fR:\fIvalue\fR switch to the next file when the time is an exact
multiple of \fIvalue\fR seconds
.Sp
\&\fBpackets\fR:\fIvalue\fR switch to the next file after it contains \fIvalue\fR
packets.
.Sp
Example: \fB\-b filesize:1000 \-b files:5\fR results in a ring buffer of five files
of size one megabyte each.
.IP "\-B  <capture buffer size>" 4
.IX Item "-B <capture buffer size>"
Set capture buffer size (in MiB, default is 2 MiB).  This is used by
the capture driver to buffer packet data until that data can be written
to disk.  If you encounter packet drops while capturing, try to increase
this size.  Note that, while \fBWireshark\fR attempts to set the buffer size
to 2 MiB by default, and can be told to set it to a larger value, the
system or interface on which you're capturing might silently limit the
capture buffer size to a lower value or raise it to a higher value.
.Sp
This is available on UNIX systems with libpcap 1.0.0 or later and on
Windows.  It is not available on UNIX systems with earlier versions of
libpcap.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the default capture buffer size.
If used after an \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the capture buffer size for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fR option occurring before
this option.  If the capture buffer size is not set specifically,
the default capture buffer size is used instead.
.IP "\-c  <capture packet count>" 4
.IX Item "-c <capture packet count>"
Set the maximum number of packets to read when capturing live
data. Same as \fB\-a packets:\fR<capture packet count>.
.IP "\-C  <configuration profile>" 4
.IX Item "-C <configuration profile>"
Start with the given configuration profile.
.IP "\-d  <layer type>==<selector>,<decode\-as protocol>" 4
.IX Item "-d <layer type>==<selector>,<decode-as protocol>"
Like Wireshark's \fBDecode As...\fR feature, this lets you specify how a
layer type should be dissected.  If the layer type in question (for example,
\&\fBtcp.port\fR or \fBudp.port\fR for a TCP or UDP port number) has the specified
selector value, packets should be dissected as the specified protocol.
.Sp
Example: \fB\-d tcp.port==8888,http\fR will decode any traffic running over
TCP port 8888 as HTTP.
.Sp
See the \fBtshark\fR\|(1) manual page for more examples.
.IP \-D 4
.IX Item "-D"
Print a list of the interfaces on which \fBWireshark\fR can capture, and
exit.  For each network interface, a number and an
interface name, possibly followed by a text description of the
interface, is printed.  The interface name or the number can be supplied
to the \fB\-i\fR flag to specify an interface on which to capture.
.Sp
This can be useful on systems that don't have a command to list them
(UNIX systems lacking \fBifconfig \-a\fR or Linux systems lacking
\&\fBip link show\fR). The number can be useful on Windows systems, where
the interface name might be a long name or a GUID.
.Sp
Note that "can capture" means that \fBWireshark\fR was able to open
that device to do a live capture; if, on your system, a program doing a
network capture must be run from an account with special privileges (for
example, as root), then, if \fBWireshark\fR is run with the \fB\-D\fR flag and
is not run from such an account, it will not list any interfaces.
.IP "\-\-display=<X display to use>" 4
.IX Item "--display=<X display to use>"
Specifies the X display to use.  A hostname and screen (otherhost:0.0)
or just a screen (:0.0) can be specified.  This option is not available
under Windows.
.IP "\-f  <capture filter>" 4
.IX Item "-f <capture filter>"
Set the capture filter expression.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the default capture filter expression.
If used after an \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the capture filter expression for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fR option occurring before
this option.  If the capture filter expression is not set specifically,
the default capture filter expression is used if provided.
.Sp
Pre-defined capture filter names, as shown in the GUI menu item Capture\->Capture Filters,
can be used by prefixing the argument with "predef:".
Example: \fB\-f "predef:MyPredefinedHostOnlyFilter"\fR
.IP \-\-fullscreen 4
.IX Item "--fullscreen"
Start Wireshark in full screen mode (kiosk mode). To exit from fullscreen mode,
open the View menu and select the Full Screen option. Alternatively, press the
F11 key (or Ctrl + Cmd + F for macOS).
.IP "\-g  <packet number>" 4
.IX Item "-g <packet number>"
After reading in a capture file using the \fB\-r\fR flag, go to the given \fIpacket number\fR.
.IP \-h 4
.IX Item "-h"
Print the version and options and exit.
.IP \-H 4
.IX Item "-H"
Hide the capture info dialog during live packet capture.
.IP "\-i  <capture interface>|\-" 4
.IX Item "-i <capture interface>|-"
Set the name of the network interface or pipe to use for live packet
capture.
.Sp
Network interface names should match one of the names listed in
"\fBwireshark \-D\fR" (described above); a number, as reported by
"\fBwireshark \-D\fR", can also be used.  If you're using UNIX, "\fBnetstat
\&\-i\fR", "\fBifconfig \-a\fR" or "\fBip link\fR" might also work to list interface names,
although not all versions of UNIX support the \fB\-a\fR flag to \fBifconfig\fR.
.Sp
If no interface is specified, \fBWireshark\fR searches the list of
interfaces, choosing the first non-loopback interface if there are any
non-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback interface if
there are no non-loopback interfaces.  If there are no interfaces at all,
\&\fBWireshark\fR reports an error and doesn't start the capture.
.Sp
Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named pipe) or "\-" to
read data from the standard input.  On Windows systems, pipe names must be
of the form "\e\epipe\e.\e\fBpipename\fR".  Data read from pipes must be in
standard pcapng or pcap format. Pcapng data must have the same
endianness as the capturing host.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times. When capturing from multiple
interfaces, the capture file will be saved in pcapng format.
.IP \-I 4
.IX Item "-I"
Put the interface in "monitor mode"; this is supported only on IEEE
802.11 Wi-Fi interfaces, and supported only on some operating systems.
.Sp
Note that in monitor mode the adapter might disassociate from the
network with which it's associated, so that you will not be able to use
any wireless networks with that adapter.  This could prevent accessing
files on a network server, or resolving host names or network addresses,
if you are capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another
network with another adapter.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fR option, it enables the monitor mode for all interfaces.
If used after an \fB\-i\fR option, it enables the monitor mode for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fR option occurring before
this option.
.IP \-j 4
.IX Item "-j"
Use after \fB\-J\fR to change the behavior when no exact match is found for
the filter.  With this option select the first packet before.
.IP "\-J  <jump filter>" 4
.IX Item "-J <jump filter>"
After reading in a capture file using the \fB\-r\fR flag, jump to the packet
matching the filter (display filter syntax).  If no exact match is found
the first packet after that is selected.
.IP \-k 4
.IX Item "-k"
Start the capture session immediately.  If the \fB\-i\fR flag was
specified, the capture uses the specified interface.  Otherwise,
\&\fBWireshark\fR searches the list of interfaces, choosing the first
non-loopback interface if there are any non-loopback interfaces, and
choosing the first loopback interface if there are no non-loopback
interfaces; if there are no interfaces, \fBWireshark\fR reports an error and
doesn't start the capture.
.IP "\-K  <keytab>" 4
.IX Item "-K <keytab>"
Load kerberos crypto keys from the specified keytab file.
This option can be used multiple times to load keys from several files.
.Sp
Example: \fB\-K krb5.keytab\fR
.IP \-l 4
.IX Item "-l"
Turn on automatic scrolling if the packet display is being updated
automatically as packets arrive during a capture (as specified by the
\&\fB\-S\fR flag).
.IP \-L 4
.IX Item "-L"
List the data link types supported by the interface and exit.
.IP \-n 4
.IX Item "-n"
Disable network object name resolution (such as hostname, TCP and UDP port
names), the \fB\-N\fR flag might override this one.
.IP "\-N  <name resolving flags>" 4
.IX Item "-N <name resolving flags>"
Turn on name resolving only for particular types of addresses and port
numbers, with name resolving for other types of addresses and port
numbers turned off.  This flag overrides \fB\-n\fR if both \fB\-N\fR and \fB\-n\fR are
present.  If both \fB\-N\fR and \fB\-n\fR flags are not present, all name resolutions
are turned on.
.Sp
The argument is a string that may contain the letters:
.Sp
\&\fBm\fR to enable MAC address resolution
.Sp
\&\fBn\fR to enable network address resolution
.Sp
\&\fBN\fR to enable using external resolvers (e.g., DNS) for network address
resolution
.Sp
\&\fBt\fR to enable transport-layer port number resolution
.Sp
\&\fBd\fR to enable resolution from captured DNS packets
.Sp
\&\fBv\fR to enable VLAN IDs to names resolution
.IP "\-o  <preference/recent setting>" 4
.IX Item "-o <preference/recent setting>"
Set a preference or recent value, overriding the default value and any value
read from a preference/recent file.  The argument to the flag is a string of
the form \fIprefname\fR\fB:\fR\fIvalue\fR, where \fIprefname\fR is the name of the
preference/recent value (which is the same name that would appear in the
preference/recent file), and \fIvalue\fR is the value to which it should be set.
Since \fBEthereal\fR 0.10.12, the recent settings replaces the formerly used
\&\-B, \-P and \-T flags to manipulate the GUI dimensions.
.Sp
If \fIprefname\fR is "uat", you can override settings in various user access
tables using the form uat\fB:\fR\fIuat filename\fR:\fIuat record\fR.  \fIuat filename\fR
must be the name of a UAT file, e.g. \fIuser_dlts\fR.  \fIuat_record\fR must be in
the form of a valid record for that file, including quotes.  For instance, to
specify a user DLT from the command line, you would use
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    \-o "uat:user_dlts:\e"User 0 (DLT=147)\e",\e"cops\e",\e"0\e",\e"\e",\e"0\e",\e"\e""
.Ve
.IP \-p 4
.IX Item "-p"
\&\fIDon't\fR put the interface into promiscuous mode.  Note that the
interface might be in promiscuous mode for some other reason; hence,
\&\fB\-p\fR cannot be used to ensure that the only traffic that is captured is
traffic sent to or from the machine on which \fBWireshark\fR is running,
broadcast traffic, and multicast traffic to addresses received by that
machine.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fR option, no interface will be put into the
promiscuous mode.
If used after an \fB\-i\fR option, the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fR
option occurring before this option will not be put into the
promiscuous mode.
.IP "\-P <path setting>" 4
.IX Item "-P <path setting>"
Special path settings usually detected automatically.  This is used for
special cases, e.g. starting Wireshark from a known location on an USB stick.
.Sp
The criterion is of the form \fIkey\fR\fB:\fR\fIpath\fR, where \fIkey\fR is one of:
.Sp
\&\fBpersconf\fR:\fIpath\fR path of personal configuration files, like the
preferences files.
.Sp
\&\fBpersdata\fR:\fIpath\fR path of personal data files, it's the folder initially
opened.  After the very first initialization, the recent file will keep the
folder last used.
.IP "\-r  <infile>" 4
.IX Item "-r <infile>"
Read packet data from \fIinfile\fR, can be any supported capture file format
(including gzipped files).  It's not possible to use named pipes or stdin
here! To capture from a pipe or from stdin use \fB\-i \-\fR
.IP "\-R  <read (display) filter>" 4
.IX Item "-R <read (display) filter>"
When reading a capture file specified with the \fB\-r\fR flag, causes the
specified filter (which uses the syntax of display filters, rather than
that of capture filters) to be applied to all packets read from the
capture file; packets not matching the filter are discarded.
.IP "\-s  <capture snaplen>" 4
.IX Item "-s <capture snaplen>"
Set the default snapshot length to use when capturing live data.
No more than \fIsnaplen\fR bytes of each network packet will be read into
memory, or saved to disk.  A value of 0 specifies a snapshot length of
262144, so that the full packet is captured; this is the default.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the default snapshot length.
If used after an \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the snapshot length for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fR option occurring before
this option.  If the snapshot length is not set specifically,
the default snapshot length is used if provided.
.IP \-S 4
.IX Item "-S"
Automatically update the packet display as packets are coming in.

Change the foreground and background colors of the packet information in
the list of packets, based upon display filters.  The list of display
filters is applied to each packet sequentially.  After the first display
filter matches a packet, any additional display filters in the list are
ignored.  Therefore, if you are filtering on the existence of protocols,
you should list the higher-level protocols first, and the lower-level
protocols last.
.RS 4
.IP "How Colorization Works" 4
.IX Item "How Colorization Works"
Packets are colored according to a list of color filters.  Each filter
consists of a name, a filter expression and a coloration.  A packet is
colored according to the first filter that it matches.  Color filter
expressions use exactly the same syntax as display filter expressions.
.Sp
When Wireshark starts, the color filters are loaded from:
.RS 4
.IP 1. 4
The user's personal color filters file or, if that does not exist,

Beware: keeping this box open results in high system load!
.IP Capture:Options 4
.IX Item "Capture:Options"
Initiate a live packet capture (see "Capture Options Dialog"
below).  If no filename is specified, a temporary file will be created
to hold the capture.  The location of the file can be chosen by setting your
TMPDIR environment variable before starting \fBWireshark\fR.  Otherwise, the
default TMPDIR location is system-dependent, but is likely either \fI/var/tmp\fR
or \fI/tmp\fR.

.IP "Analyze:Apply as Filter" 4
.IX Item "Analyze:Apply as Filter"
Create a display filter based on the data currently highlighted in the
packet details and apply the filter.
.Sp
If that data is a field that can be tested in a display filter
expression, the display filter will test that field; otherwise, the
display filter will be based on the absolute offset within the packet.
Therefore it could be unreliable if the packet contains protocols with
variable-length headers, such as a source-routed token-ring packet.
.Sp
The \fBSelected\fR option creates a display filter that tests for a match
of the data; the \fBNot Selected\fR option creates a display filter that
tests for a non-match of the data.  The \fBAnd Selected\fR, \fBOr Selected\fR,
\&\fBAnd Not Selected\fR, and \fBOr Not Selected\fR options add to the end of
the display filter in the strip at the top (or bottom) an AND or OR
operator followed by the new display filter expression.
.IP "Analyze:Prepare a Filter" 4
.IX Item "Analyze:Prepare a Filter"
Create a display filter based on the data currently highlighted in the
packet details.  The filter strip at the top (or bottom) is updated but
it is not yet applied.
.IP "Analyze:Enabled Protocols" 4
.IX Item "Analyze:Enabled Protocols"
Allow protocol dissection to be enabled or disabled for a specific
protocol.  Individual protocols can be enabled or disabled by clicking
on them in the list or by highlighting them and pressing the space bar.
The entire list can be enabled, disabled, or inverted using the buttons
below the list.
.Sp
When a protocol is disabled, dissection in a particular packet stops
when that protocol is reached, and Wireshark moves on to the next packet.
Any higher-layer protocols that would otherwise have been processed will
not be displayed.  For example, disabling TCP will prevent the dissection
and display of TCP, HTTP, SMTP, Telnet, and any other protocol exclusively
dependent on TCP.
.Sp
The list of protocols can be saved, so that Wireshark will start up with
the protocols in that list disabled.
.IP "Analyze:Decode As" 4
.IX Item "Analyze:Decode As"
If you have a packet selected, present a dialog allowing you to change
which dissectors are used to decode this packet.  The dialog has one
panel each for the link layer, network layer and transport layer
protocol/port numbers, and will allow each of these to be changed
independently.  For example, if the selected packet is a TCP packet to
port 12345, using this dialog you can instruct Wireshark to decode all
packets to or from that TCP port as HTTP packets.
.IP "Analyze:User Specified Decodes" 4
.IX Item "Analyze:User Specified Decodes"
Create a new window showing whether any protocol ID to dissector
mappings have been changed by the user.  This window also allows the
user to reset all decodes to their default values.
.IP "Analyze:Follow TCP Stream" 4
.IX Item "Analyze:Follow TCP Stream"
If you have a TCP packet selected, display the contents of the data
stream for the TCP connection to which that packet belongs, as text, in
a separate window, and leave the list of packets in a filtered state,
with only those packets that are part of that TCP connection being
displayed.  You can revert to your old view by pressing ENTER in the
display filter text box, thereby invoking your old display filter (or
resetting it back to no display filter).
.Sp
The window in which the data stream is displayed lets you select:
.RS 4

packets in which the protocol exists, a count is also made for packets
in which the protocol is the last protocol in the stack.  These
last-protocol counts show you how many packets (and the byte count
associated with those packets) \fBended\fR in a particular protocol.  In
the table, they are listed under "End Packets" and "End Bytes".

.IP "Statistics:IO Graphs" 4
.IX Item "Statistics:IO Graphs"
Open a window where up to 5 graphs in different colors can be displayed
to indicate number of packets or number of bytes per second for all packets
matching the specified filter.
By default only one graph will be displayed showing number of packets per second.
.Sp
The top part of the window contains the graphs and scales for the X and
Y axis.  If the graph is too long to fit inside the window there is a
horizontal scrollbar below the drawing area that can scroll the graphs
to the left or the right.  The horizontal axis displays the time into
the capture and the vertical axis will display the measured quantity at
that time.
.Sp
Below the drawing area and the scrollbar are the controls.  On the
bottom left there will be five similar sets of controls to control each
individual graph such as "Display:<button>" which button will toggle
that individual graph on/off.  If <button> is ticked, the graph will be
displayed. "Color:<color>" which is just a button to show which color
will be used to draw that graph. Finally "Filter:<filter\-text>" which
can be used to specify a display filter for that particular graph.
.Sp
If filter-text is empty then all packets will be used to calculate the
quantity for that graph.  If filter-text is specified only those packets
that match that display filter will be considered in the calculation of
quantity.
.Sp
To the right of the 5 graph controls there are four menus to control
global aspects of the draw area and graphs.  The "Unit:" menu is used to
control what to measure; "packets/tick", "bytes/tick" or "advanced..."
.Sp
packets/tick will measure the number of packets matching the (if
specified) display filter for the graph in each measurement interval.
.Sp
bytes/tick will measure the total number of bytes in all packets matching
the (if specified) display filter for the graph in each measurement
interval.
.Sp
advanced... see below
.Sp
"Tick interval:" specifies what measurement intervals to use.  The
default is 1 second and means that the data will be counted over 1
second intervals.
.Sp
"Pixels per tick:" specifies how many pixels wide each measurement
interval will be in the drawing area.  The default is 5 pixels per tick.
.Sp
"Y\-scale:" controls the max value for the y\-axis.  Default value is
"auto" which means that \fBWireshark\fR will try to adjust the maxvalue
automatically.
.Sp
"advanced..." If Unit:advanced...  is selected the window will display
two more controls for each of the five graphs.  One control will be a
menu where the type of calculation can be selected from
SUM,COUNT,MAX,MIN,AVG and LOAD, and one control, textbox, where the name of a
single display filter field can be specified.
.Sp
The following restrictions apply to type and field combinations:
.Sp
SUM: available for all types of integers and will calculate the SUM of
all occurrences of this field in the measurement interval.  Note that
some field can occur multiple times in the same packet and then all
instances will be summed up.  Example: 'tcp.len' which will count the
amount of payload data transferred across TCP in each interval.
.Sp
COUNT: available for all field types.  This will COUNT the number of times
certain field occurs in each interval.  Note that some fields
may occur multiple times in each packet and if that is the case
then each instance will be counted independently and COUNT
will be greater than the number of packets.
.Sp
MAX: available for all integer and relative time fields.  This will calculate
the max seen integer/time value seen for the field during the interval.
Example: 'smb.time' which will plot the maximum SMB response time.
.Sp
MIN: available for all integer and relative time fields.  This will calculate
the min seen integer/time value seen for the field during the interval.
Example: 'smb.time' which will plot the minimum SMB response time.
.Sp
AVG: available for all integer and relative time fields.This will
calculate the average seen integer/time value seen for the field during
the interval.  Example: 'smb.time' which will plot the average SMB
response time.
.Sp
LOAD: available only for relative time fields (response times).
.Sp
Example of advanced:
Display how NFS response time MAX/MIN/AVG changes over time:
.Sp
Set first graph to:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   filter:nfs&&rpc.time
\&   Calc:MAX rpc.time

.Sp
Set first graph to
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   filter:ip.addr==a.b.c.d&&frame.pkt_len
\&   Calc:AVG frame.pkt_len
.Ve
.Sp
LOAD:
The LOAD io-stat type is very different from anything you have ever seen
before! While the response times themselves as plotted by MIN,MAX,AVG are
indications on the Server load (which affects the Server response time),
the LOAD measurement measures the Client LOAD.
What this measures is how much workload the client generates,
i.e. how fast will the client issue new commands when the previous ones
completed.
i.e. the level of concurrency the client can maintain.
The higher the number, the more and faster is the client issuing new
commands.  When the LOAD goes down, it may be due to client load making
the client slower in issuing new commands (there may be other reasons as
well, maybe the client just doesn't have any commands it wants to issue
right then).
.Sp
Load is measured in concurrency/number of overlapping i/o and the value
1000 means there is a constant load of one i/o.
.Sp
In each tick interval the amount of overlap is measured.
See the graph below containing three commands:
Below the graph are the LOAD values for each interval that would be calculated.

The global \fIdisabled_protos\fR file uses the same directory as the global
preferences file.
.Sp
The personal \fIdisabled_protos\fR file uses the same directory as the
personal preferences file.
.Sp
Note: Whenever the disabled protocols list is saved by using the \fISave\fR
button in the \fIAnalyze:Enabled Protocols\fR dialog box, your personal
disabled protocols file will be overwritten with the new settings,
destroying any comments that were in the file.
.IP "Name Resolution (hosts)" 4
.IX Item "Name Resolution (hosts)"
If the personal \fIhosts\fR file exists, it is
used to resolve IPv4 and IPv6 addresses before any other
attempts are made to resolve them.  The file has the standard \fIhosts\fR
file syntax; each line contains one IP address and name, separated by
whitespace.  The same directory as for the personal preferences file is used.
.Sp
Capture filter name resolution is handled by libpcap on UNIX-compatible
systems and WinPcap on Windows.  As such the Wireshark personal \fIhosts\fR file
will not be consulted for capture filter name resolution.
.IP "Name Resolution (subnets)" 4
.IX Item "Name Resolution (subnets)"
If an IPv4 address cannot be translated via name resolution (no exact
match is found) then a partial match is attempted via the \fIsubnets\fR file.
Both the global \fIsubnets\fR file and personal \fIsubnets\fR files are used
if they exist.
.Sp
Each line of this file consists of an IPv4 address, a subnet mask length
separated only by a / and a name separated by whitespace. While the address
must be a full IPv4 address, any values beyond the mask length are subsequently
ignored.
.Sp
An example is:
.Sp
# Comments must be prepended by the # sign!
192.168.0.0/24 ws_test_network
.Sp
A partially matched name will be printed as "subnet\-name.remaining\-address".
For example, "192.168.0.1" under the subnet above would be printed as
"ws_test_network.1"; if the mask length above had been 16 rather than 24, the
printed address would be ``ws_test_network.0.1".
.IP "Name Resolution (ethers)" 4
.IX Item "Name Resolution (ethers)"
The \fIethers\fR files are consulted to correlate 6\-byte hardware addresses to
names.  First the personal \fIethers\fR file is tried and if an address is not
found there the global \fIethers\fR file is tried next.
.Sp
Each line contains one hardware address and name, separated by
whitespace.  The digits of the hardware address are separated by colons
(:), dashes (\-) or periods (.).  The same separator character must be
used consistently in an address.  The following three lines are valid
lines of an \fIethers\fR file:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff          Broadcast
\&  c0\-00\-ff\-ff\-ff\-ff          TR_broadcast
\&  00.00.00.00.00.00          Zero_broadcast
.Ve
.Sp
The global \fIethers\fR file is looked for in the \fI/etc\fR directory on
UNIX-compatible systems, and in the main installation directory (for
example, \fIC:\eProgram Files\eWireshark\fR) on Windows systems.
.Sp
The personal \fIethers\fR file is looked for in the same directory as the personal
preferences file.
.Sp
Capture filter name resolution is handled by libpcap on UNIX-compatible
systems and WinPcap on Windows.  As such the Wireshark personal \fIethers\fR file
will not be consulted for capture filter name resolution.
.IP "Name Resolution (manuf)" 4
.IX Item "Name Resolution (manuf)"
The \fImanuf\fR file is used to match the 3\-byte vendor portion of a 6\-byte
hardware address with the manufacturer's name; it can also contain well-known
MAC addresses and address ranges specified with a netmask.  The format of the
file is the same as the \fIethers\fR files, except that entries such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  00:00:0C      Cisco
.Ve
.Sp
can be provided, with the 3\-byte OUI and the name for a vendor, and
entries such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  00\-00\-0C\-07\-AC/40     All\-HSRP\-routers
.Ve
.Sp
can be specified, with a MAC address and a mask indicating how many bits
of the address must match.  The above entry, for example, has 40
significant bits, or 5 bytes, and would match addresses from
00\-00\-0C\-07\-AC\-00 through 00\-00\-0C\-07\-AC\-FF.  The mask need not be a
multiple of 8.
.Sp
The \fImanuf\fR file is looked for in the same directory as the global
preferences file.
.IP "Name Resolution (services)" 4
.IX Item "Name Resolution (services)"
The \fIservices\fR file is used to translate port numbers into names.
Both the global \fIservices\fR file and personal \fIservices\fR files are used
if they exist.
.Sp
The file has the standard \fIservices\fR file syntax; each line contains one
(service) name and one transport identifier separated by white space.  The
transport identifier includes one port number and one transport protocol name
(typically tcp, udp, or sctp) separated by a /.
.Sp
An example is:
.Sp
mydns       5045/udp     # My own Domain Name Server
mydns       5045/tcp     # My own Domain Name Server
.IP "Name Resolution (ipxnets)" 4
.IX Item "Name Resolution (ipxnets)"
The \fIipxnets\fR files are used to correlate 4\-byte IPX network numbers to
names.  First the global \fIipxnets\fR file is tried and if that address is not
found there the personal one is tried next.
.Sp
The format is the same as the \fIethers\fR
file, except that each address is four bytes instead of six.
Additionally, the address can be represented as a single hexadecimal
number, as is more common in the IPX world, rather than four hex octets.
For example, these four lines are valid lines of an \fIipxnets\fR file:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  C0.A8.2C.00              HR
\&  c0\-a8\-1c\-00              CEO
\&  00:00:BE:EF              IT_Server1
\&  110f                     FileServer3
.Ve
.Sp
The global \fIipxnets\fR file is looked for in the \fI/etc\fR directory on
UNIX-compatible systems, and in the main installation directory (for
example, \fIC:\eProgram Files\eWireshark\fR) on Windows systems.
.Sp
The personal \fIipxnets\fR file is looked for in the same directory as the
personal preferences file.
.IP "Capture Filters" 4
.IX Item "Capture Filters"
The \fIcfilters\fR files contain system-wide and personal capture filters.
Each line contains one filter, starting with the string displayed in the
dialog box in quotation marks, followed by the filter string itself:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  "HTTP" port 80
\&  "DCERPC" port 135
.Ve
.Sp
The global \fIcfilters\fR file uses the same directory as the
global preferences file.
.Sp
The personal \fIcfilters\fR file uses the same directory as the personal
preferences file.  It is written through the Capture:Capture Filters
dialog.
.Sp
If the global \fIcfilters\fR file exists, it is used only if the personal
\&\fIcfilters\fR file does not exist; global and personal capture filters are
not merged.
.IP "Display Filters" 4
.IX Item "Display Filters"
The \fIdfilters\fR files contain system-wide and personal display filters.
Each line contains one filter, starting with the string displayed in the
dialog box in quotation marks, followed by the filter string itself:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  "HTTP" http
\&  "DCERPC" dcerpc
.Ve
.Sp
The global \fIdfilters\fR file uses the same directory as the
global preferences file.
.Sp
The personal \fIdfilters\fR file uses the same directory as the
personal preferences file.  It is written through the Analyze:Display
Filters dialog.
.Sp
If the global \fIdfilters\fR file exists, it is used only if the personal
\&\fIdfilters\fR file does not exist; global and personal display filters are
not merged.
.IP "Color Filters (Coloring Rules)" 4
.IX Item "Color Filters (Coloring Rules)"
The \fIcolorfilters\fR files contain system-wide and personal color filters.
Each line contains one filter, starting with the string displayed in the
dialog box, followed by the corresponding display filter.  Then the
background and foreground colors are appended:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  # a comment
\&  @tcp@tcp@[59345,58980,65534][0,0,0]
\&  @udp@udp@[28834,57427,65533][0,0,0]
.Ve
.Sp
The global \fIcolorfilters\fR file uses the same directory as the
global preferences file.
.Sp
The personal \fIcolorfilters\fR file uses the same directory as the
personal preferences file.  It is written through the View:Coloring Rules
dialog.
.Sp
If the global \fIcolorfilters\fR file exists, it is used only if the personal
\&\fIcolorfilters\fR file does not exist; global and personal color filters are
not merged.
.IP Plugins 4
.IX Item "Plugins"
See above in the description of the About:Plugins page.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IP WIRESHARK_APPDATA 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_APPDATA"
On Windows, Wireshark normally stores all application data in \f(CW%APPDATA\fR% or
\&\f(CW%USERPROFILE\fR%.  You can override the default location by exporting this
environment variable to specify an alternate location.
.IP WIRESHARK_DEBUG_WMEM_OVERRIDE 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_DEBUG_WMEM_OVERRIDE"
Setting this environment variable forces the wmem framework to use the
specified allocator backend for *all* allocations, regardless of which
backend is normally specified by the code. This is mainly useful to developers
when testing or debugging. See \fIREADME.wmem\fR in the source distribution for
details.
.IP WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY"
This environment variable causes the plugins and other data files to be loaded
from the build directory (where the program was compiled) rather than from the
standard locations.  It has no effect when the program in question is running
with root (or setuid) permissions on *NIX.
.IP WIRESHARK_DATA_DIR 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_DATA_DIR"
This environment variable causes the various data files to be loaded from
a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no effect when the
program in question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on *NIX.
.IP ERF_RECORDS_TO_CHECK 4
.IX Item "ERF_RECORDS_TO_CHECK"
This environment variable controls the number of ERF records checked when
deciding if a file really is in the ERF format.  Setting this environment
variable a number higher than the default (20) would make false positives
less likely.
.IP IPFIX_RECORDS_TO_CHECK 4
.IX Item "IPFIX_RECORDS_TO_CHECK"
This environment variable controls the number of IPFIX records checked when
deciding if a file really is in the IPFIX format.  Setting this environment
variable a number higher than the default (20) would make false positives
less likely.
.IP WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG"
If this environment variable is set, \fBWireshark\fR will call \fBabort\fR\|(3)
when a dissector bug is encountered.  \fBabort\fR\|(3) will cause the program to
exit abnormally; if you are running \fBWireshark\fR in a debugger, it
should halt in the debugger and allow inspection of the process, and, if
you are not running it in a debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming
your environment is configured correctly, generate a core dump file.
This can be useful to developers attempting to troubleshoot a problem
with a protocol dissector.
.IP WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_TOO_MANY_ITEMS 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_TOO_MANY_ITEMS"
If this environment variable is set, \fBWireshark\fR will call \fBabort\fR\|(3)
if a dissector tries to add too many items to a tree (generally this
is an indication of the dissector not breaking out of a loop soon enough).
\&\fBabort\fR\|(3) will cause the program to exit abnormally; if you are running
\&\fBWireshark\fR in a debugger, it should halt in the debugger and allow
inspection of the process, and, if you are not running it in a debugger,
it will, on some OSes, assuming your environment is configured correctly,
generate a core dump file.  This can be useful to developers attempting to
troubleshoot a problem with a protocol dissector.
.IP WIRESHARK_QUIT_AFTER_CAPTURE 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_QUIT_AFTER_CAPTURE"
Cause \fBWireshark\fR to exit after the end of the capture session.  This
doesn't automatically start a capture; you must still use \fB\-k\fR to do
that.  You must also specify an autostop condition, e.g.  \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-a
duration:...\fR.  This means that you will not be able to see the results
of the capture after it stops; it's primarily useful for testing.
